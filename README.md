## JSON-parser

This is a personal project to explore an interest of mine. The aim is to build a parser capable of parsing JSON data and validating it as well as building an Abstract Syntax Tree.

Next targets are to build a website that allows users to parse and validate JSON data.

## Development goals

- [x] Parser can parse all types of valid JSON data
- [ ] Parser reports errors
- [ ] Parser recovers from errors 
- [ ] Build server to listen to requests
- [ ] Built website interface
